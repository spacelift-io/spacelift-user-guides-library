  difficulty: "medium"
  minutesToComplete: 25
  prerequisites:
    - "You should have a working stack (orbit-labs-demo) with S3 bucket"
    - "Basic understanding of Terraform outputs and variables"

steps:
  - order: 1
    title: "Create Networking Repository"
    instruction: "In your VCS provider, create a new repository called 'orbit-labs-networking'. Create a main.tf file with this code: 'provider \"aws\" { region = \"us-east-1\" }' and 'resource \"aws_vpc\" \"main\" { cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/16\" tags = { Name = \"Orbit Labs VPC\", project = \"orbit-labs\" } }' and 'resource \"aws_subnet\" \"main\" { vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id, cidr_block = \"10.0.1.0/24\", availability_zone = \"us-east-1a\", tags = { Name = \"Orbit Labs Subnet\", project = \"orbit-labs\" } }' and 'output \"subnet_id\" { value = aws_subnet.main.id, description = \"ID of the main subnet\" }'. Commit and push."
    hint: "This creates basic networking infrastructure: a VPC and a subnet. The output 'subnet_id' is crucial - it's what we'll pass to the app stack. Outputs are how stacks share data with each other."
    validation: "User confirms they created the networking repository with VPC, subnet, and output"

  - order: 2
    title: "Create Networking Stack in Spacelift"
    instruction: "Go to 'Ship Infra' > 'Stacks' and click 'Create stack'. Name: 'orbit-labs-networking', Space: 'root', Description: 'Network infrastructure for Orbit Labs', Labels: 'network,infrastructure'. Click Continue. Select your VCS integration and the 'orbit-labs-networking' repository, branch 'main'. Click Continue. Select 'Terraform', 'Latest' version, enable 'Smart Sanitization' and 'Manage State'. Click 'Create & Continue'. Attach your AWS integration with Read and Write access."
    hint: "This networking stack will be the parent - it runs first and provides outputs to dependent stacks. We're setting it up just like your first stack, but with different code."
    validation: "Networking stack exists"

  - order: 3
    title: "Deploy Networking Stack"
    instruction: "Navigate to your networking stack and click 'Trigger'. Start a tracked run. Review the plan - it should show creating 1 VPC and 1 subnet. Click 'Confirm' to apply. Wait for the run to complete successfully. Once finished, check the 'Outputs' section - you should see 'subnet_id' with a value like 'subnet-abc123'."
    hint: "The subnet_id output is now available for other stacks to use. This is the foundation that the app stack will depend on. Copy this subnet ID if you want to verify it later."
    validation: "Networking stack has completed at least one successful run with outputs"

  - order: 4
    title: "Configure App Stack to Accept Input"
    instruction: "In your original repository (spacelift-demo), edit main.tf to add a variable at the top: 'variable \"subnet_id\" { type = string, description = \"ID of the subnet from networking stack\" }'. Then add a resource that uses this variable: 'resource \"aws_security_group\" \"app\" { name = \"orbit-labs-app-sg\", description = \"Security group for Orbit Labs app\", vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.selected.id, tags = { Name = \"Orbit Labs App SG\", project = \"orbit-labs\" } }' and 'data \"aws_subnet\" \"selected\" { id = var.subnet_id }' and 'data \"aws_vpc\" \"selected\" { id = data.aws_subnet.selected.vpc_id }'. Commit and push."
    hint: "We're adding a variable that will receive the subnet_id from the networking stack. The security group resource will be created in the VPC that the subnet belongs to, creating a real dependency between the stacks."
    validation: "User confirms they added variable and resources that depend on subnet_id"

  - order: 5
    title: "Create Stack Dependency with Output Reference"
    instruction: "Navigate to your networking stack (orbit-labs-networking) and go to the 'Dependencies' tab. Click 'Add dependencies' under the 'Depended on by' section. Select your app stack (orbit-labs-demo) from the dropdown. Click 'Save'. Then on the dependency you just created, click 'Add output reference'. In 'Output name', enter 'subnet_id'. In 'Input name', enter 'TF_VAR_subnet_id'. Click 'Save'."
    hint: "This establishes the relationship AND the data flow: networking stack is the parent, app stack is the child. The subnet_id output will automatically pass as the subnet_id variable to the app stack. No manual copying needed - Spacelift handles it!"
    validation: "Dependency relationship exists with output reference configured"

  - order: 6
    title: "Test Dependency Chain and Observe Cascading Execution"
    instruction: "In your networking repository (orbit-labs-networking), edit main.tf and add a tag to the VPC: 'Owner = \"Saturnhead\"'. Commit and push this change. In Spacelift, navigate to your networking stack and observe the triggered run. After it completes successfully, navigate to your app stack (orbit-labs-demo) Runs tab. You should see a new run automatically triggered with 'Triggered by dependency'. Open this run and check the 'Environment' section - you should see 'TF_VAR_subnet_id' with the subnet ID value. The run should successfully create the security group in the correct VPC."
    hint: "This is stack orchestration in action! The networking stack completed → Spacelift automatically triggered the app stack → the subnet_id was passed automatically → the app stack used it to create resources in the right network. This is how you coordinate complex, multi-stack infrastructure. The network team and app team can now work independently without stepping on each other. Orbit Labs has proper separation of concerns! 🎯"
    validation: "App stack was automatically triggered and received subnet_id from networking stack"

completion:
  successMessage: "Incredible! You've mastered stack dependencies and orchestration. Orbit Labs can now manage complex, multi-tier infrastructure with automated coordination between teams."
