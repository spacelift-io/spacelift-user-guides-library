  difficulty: "easy"
  minutesToComplete: 20
  prerequisites:
    - "You should have a GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps account."

steps:
  - order: 1
    title: "Connect Your VCS Provider"
    instruction: "Navigate to Integrate services > Integrations. Filter by your version control system (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps) and click 'View'. Click 'Set up [your vcs type]' and follow the authorization prompts to connect your account to Spacelift."
    hint: "Spacelift needs access to your repositories to track infrastructure changes. Don't worry - you can control which repositories Spacelift can see during the authorization process."
    validation: "VCS integration exists"

  - order: 2
    title: "Create a Test Repository"
    instruction: "In your connected VCS provider, create a new repository called 'spacelift-demo' or 'orbit-labs-demo'. Create a file named 'main.tf' in the root with this simple Terraform code: 'resource \"random_pet\" \"orbit_mascot\" { length = 2 }'. Commit and push this file to the main/master branch."
    hint: "This simple Terraform configuration creates a random pet name - perfect for testing! The random_pet resource doesn't require any cloud credentials, making it ideal for your first run."
    validation: "User confirms they have created a repository with a main.tf file containing the random_pet resource"

  - order: 3
    title: "Create Your First Stack"
    instruction: "In Spacelift, go to 'Ship Infra' > 'Stacks' and click 'Create stack'. Fill in the stack creation wizard: 1) Name: 'orbit-labs-demo', Space: 'root', Description: 'My first Spacelift stack', Label: 'demo'. Click 'Continue'. 2) Select your VCS integration, choose your repository (spacelift-demo), Branch: 'main' or 'master'. Click 'Continue'. 3) Workflow tool: 'Terraform', Version: 'Latest', Enable 'Smart Sanitization' and 'Manage State'. Click 'Create & Continue'."
    hint: "The stack creation wizard guides you through three main sections: Basic info, VCS connection, and Backend configuration. Take your time to fill in each section - you can always edit these settings later. Spacelift managing your state is much safer than storing it locally!"
    validation: "Confirm stack was created"

  - order: 4
    title: "Trigger Your First Run"
    instruction: "Navigate to your newly created stack (orbit-labs-demo). Click the 'Trigger' button in the top right corner. Select 'Tracked run' as the run type. Optionally add a note like 'First mission launch!' and click 'Trigger'. Watch as Spacelift initializes your workspace and begins the planning phase."
    hint: "A run goes through several phases: INITIALIZING → PLANNING → UNCONFIRMED (waiting for your approval) → APPLYING → FINISHED. Don't worry, you'll have a chance to review everything before any changes are made!"
    validation: "Confirm stack has at least one run initiated"

  - order: 5
    title: "Review and Confirm the Plan"
    instruction: "After the planning phase completes, the run will enter UNCONFIRMED state. Review the plan output carefully - you should see that Terraform wants to create 1 resource (the random_pet.orbit_mascot). The plan shows exactly what will be created with a green '+' symbol. Since everything looks good, click the 'Confirm' button to proceed with applying the changes."
    hint: "Always review the plan carefully before confirming! This is your safety checkpoint. In this case, we're just creating a harmless random pet name (no real infrastructure or costs), so it's completely safe. The green '+' means 'create', '~' means 'modify', and '-' means 'delete'."
    validation: "User has reviewed the plan and confirmed the run to proceed to apply phase"

  - order: 6
    title: "Watch Your First Deployment Complete"
    instruction: "Observe the APPLYING phase as Spacelift executes your Terraform code. You'll see real-time logs showing Terraform creating your random_pet resource. When it completes successfully, the run state will change to 'FINISHED' with a green checkmark. Click on the 'Outputs' section or the run details to see your randomly generated pet name!"
    hint: "Congratulations! You've just completed your first Spacelift deployment. This is 'mission control' in action - your code went from repository to deployed infrastructure with full visibility, audit trail, and control. The random pet name you see (something like 'happy-dolphin' or 'brave-tiger') is your first resource managed by Spacelift!"
    validation: "Confirm stack has successfully completed at least one run with FINISHED state"

  successMessage: "Mission accomplished! You've successfully connected your VCS, created your first stack, and completed a deployment. You're now ready to explore more advanced Spacelift features."
